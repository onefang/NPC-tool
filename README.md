This is an early release of onefang's NPC tool, for controlling NPCs in
OpenSim.  It's a bit rough, and subject to change.

Note that the file names have been changed to better suit a variety of
operating systems, but it's important for the names to be changed back
when you bring these scripts into OpenSim, coz the scripts refer to each
other by name.  Just replace the "_" character in the name with a space
" ".

The scripts also rely on an object called "locator beacon", you should
make this something big and visible from a distance, and put "locator
beacon script" inside of it, then put this object inside what ever has
the "NPC tool" script.
